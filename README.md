### 🚀 What I’m Learning  

**📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
- Learning through the **Real DSA** community → [Real DSA](https://realdsa.com)
- Focus: problem solving, logic, and patterns

**🎨 Frontend Development**  
- Following [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) and [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com)  
- Currently exploring:  
  - HTML (structure)  
  - CSS (styling & layout)

### 🧠 My Focus Right Now  

- Build consistency  
- Master the basics  
- Start small projects to apply what I learn  
- Keep improving one line of code at a time

### 🌱 Growth Mindset  

> "Start small. Stay consistent. Build momentum."  

Every day, I’m trying to learn something new — whether it’s solving a DSA problem or building a small webpage.  
This is just the beginning.
